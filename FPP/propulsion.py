This is the propulsion file for the model

Inputs from chosen engine: AI-450S or M250 B17F (for now) (450 shp)

Other candidates: 
    GE H80 (or H75)
    Some diesel (Continental CD300 or so)
    PT6A (medium version)
    
Using Blade Element Theory, I calculate the propellor chacteristics.
    (mainly efficiency and power available)
